Social media has enabled people to voice their thoughts whenever they desire, to how large or small of an audience they desire. It can be used as a platform to post life achievements, raise awareness on a topic, or even to simply rant. As long as people have a readily available platform to share their feelings, they will continue to do so. 

Because it is so readily available, social media has drastically changed the way people react to huge events. Without having to wait for newspapers or for other more traditional media sources to receive news, people have the ability to learn about devastating events hours, even moments after they happen. This means people often post their immediate, visceral reactions to an event, which is what we were interested in and wanted to look at further. 

After the 2015 Charlottesville attack, thousands of people took to Twitter to discuss their feelings through hundreds of thousands of tweets, and these sentiments were broadcast to everyone. For our project, we decided to focus on these tweets in the four days following the incident. We wanted to see trends in the sentiment behind what people were tweeting day-to-day, the length of the tweets day-to-day, the number of followers a user had relative to how active they were on Twitter after the incident, and any patterns in when the tweets were posted. In doing so, we found some trends that show how social media, more specifically Twitter, has enabled people to share their thoughts as fast as they can.
